# Zip_Viewer

I have used JSZip API for listing and downloaing the files.  
In this project initially we need to upload our zip file and all the files inside the zip folder will be viewed below  
I have listing the files using JSZip loadAsync method  
Then i have used generateAsync method for downloading the files but right now I'm facing an issue that the downloaded files content are not in a viewable   format , hope i will fix it soon.
